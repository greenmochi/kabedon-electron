## VS Code configuration
If you're using vscode to develop, it is highly recommended to enable the
virtual environment through vscode as well.

`Command palette > Python: Select Interpreter`

Select the virtualenv created for this project.

The integrated terminal will also automatically start the virtualenv in its
shell. As always, check with `pip -V`.
