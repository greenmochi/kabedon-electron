# ultimate-proto
This repository holds all the protobuf files for the ultimate project. All projects except for ultimate-proto
should **not** have any .proto files. All generated server and client stubs should be compiled, built, and tested here. The projects or services
using any generated gRPC stubs should have their own tests for any stubs as well.
